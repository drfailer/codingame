# DETECTIVE PIKAPTCHA EP1

## STATEMENT

Detective Pikaptcha is investigating a disturbance in the spacetime
continuum. It seems a powerful pok√©bot is being used to warp space around our
hero to keep him trapped. Help him map his surroundings in order to escape and
uncover the culprit!

Your objective is to write a program that will compute, for each cell of a grid,
the number of adjacent passages.

## Rules

You're given a grid filled with 0 and #, where 0 represents a passage, and #
represents a wall: an impassable cell.

We're considering the 4-adjacency, meaning a cell has a maximum of 4 adjacent
cells (a diagonal cell is not adjacent).

You must analyze the given grid and return it with a small transformation: for
each empty cell, instead of a 0, you must return the number of its adjacent
passable cells. For each impassable cell, you change nothing: you still return
#.
